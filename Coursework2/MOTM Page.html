<p>Kevin De Bruyne scored four goals as Manchester City overwhelmed Wolves 5-1 at Molineux to go three points clear at the top of the Premier League table and move within four points of the title

The Belgian took just 24 minutes to complete his hat-trick, making Leander Dendoncker's early equaliser irrelevant, before adding a fourth goal in the second half.

Raheem Sterling scored a fifth but this night belonged to one man. It was a masterclass from the midfielder - his first-half triple all coming with his left foot - with the win restoring City's three-point advantage over Liverpool with two games to go.</p>
